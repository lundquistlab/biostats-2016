#Biostats Tests

Here I will post the tests from Biostats 2016. 


##For test 1:
1. Look over your test (handed back 3/3/16)
2. Fill in the questions with the correct answers into the blank copy [Tests/exam-1](https://github.com/mlundquist/biostats-2016/blob/master/Tests/exam-1.pdf)
3. Send in a corrected copy to my [email](mailto:mlundqu1@binghamton.edu) by 11:59 on 3/11/2016

This will count as a homework/quiz
