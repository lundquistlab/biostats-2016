##Clueless Botanist Group Project

"I am a botanist and I have some wonderful data (iris.txt)! I have been told by other botanists that there are three species of Iris. I think they are wrong!"

**Your job:**

Use the statistical and data visualizing tools that we have gone over in class so far to test the botanist's hypothesis.

Work as a group to write a 1-2 page report with figures and your conclusions.
