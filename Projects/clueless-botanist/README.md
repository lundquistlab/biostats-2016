##Clueless Botanist Group Project

"I am a botanist and I have some wonderful data (iris.txt)! I have been told by other botanists that there are three species of Iris. I think they are wrong!"


**Additional information:** 

"*Setosa* was collected in the high mountains of the Rockie's, which is its entire range."

"*Virginica* was collected from Virginia during spring break in March. It exists all along the East Coast but was not collected in PA or southern NY. *Versicolor*, which does have some range overlap with *Virginica*, was collected in northern NY later in the summer."

**Your job:**

Use the statistical and data visualizing tools that we have gone over in class so far to test the botanist's hypothesis.

Work as a group to write a 1-2 page report with figures and your conclusions.

**Grade: 20 points**
