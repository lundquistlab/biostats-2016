#Portfolios

**Second Portfolio Section DUE 3/25/2016**

**DUE: Non-parametric variance tests and parametric ANOVAs**

The portfolio will be one of the most important things that you will produce in Biol 483N.

The portfolio is a **curated** collection of the prototypes that you write throughout the semester. Each "chapter" of your portfolio should loosely correspond with Dr. Stein's portfolio, [Biologist's Analytic Toolkit](http://biotoolbox.binghamton.edu). However, your portfolio is for you and needs to be written in your own words so that you can use it in the future as a reference tool for running different types of statistical tests.

Above is a sample of my portfolio that I have put together. I have organized it such that every folder contains the resources I need to run a specific statistical test. I have also written a table of contents in the README.md.

In each individual folder, I include everything I need to run the tests (a .r script), evaluate if the tests were successful (example data and outputs), and a "human language" explanation of the tests (as a .pdf).


#Portfolio grading considerations

1. Organization
    - Your portfolio organized in such a way that anyone could find a particular test easily.
    - File and folder names descriptive (i.e. "1_DiscriptiveStats", **not** "Folder1" or "stat1.r").
2. Completeness
    - All statistical tests covered in lecture (see [BAT](http://biotoolbox.binghamton.edu)) are prototyped.
    - All folders contain at least an .r script and a .pdf of outputs and explanations
3. Accuracy
    - Your .r scripts work the way that you intend without any errors
    - Your annotations and explanations in your .pdf are factually correct
4. Spelling and Format
    - Format is consistent throughout
    - No spelling or grammatical errors
