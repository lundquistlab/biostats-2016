##Week 6 ANOVA Project

Over the past couple of weeks we have been working on one sample and two sample comparisons. **Today** we will be doing a multiple comparison using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). 

We will be working with a modified version of the iris data that you should be very familiar with. 

**Answer the following questions:**

1. What are the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA? 

2. Run an ANOVA comparing the pedal width of the three iris species using both anova(lm()) and oneway.test().

3. What is the interpretation of the results from those two functions?.

4. Which test is most appropriate?

5. What is the next step for analysis? Hint: Remember that this is an omnibus test.
