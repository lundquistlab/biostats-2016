# Choosing optimal models using AIC (etc.) and F tests #

You have all seen the `streams.txt` data set in ANOVA-2. You may have noticed that there are a number of predictor variables as well as grouping variables. In other words, there is a lot of data and a lot of potential models for predicting your Y variable. 

In this exercise, using **richness** as your Y, I want you to:

1. Build a full model to predict a particular Y variable using multiple numeric and/or grouping X variables and provide an ANOVA table for that "Full Model."

2. Is the full model the most optimal? Use at least 3 model selection criteria (Biostats 401, p. 2-3) to compare your "Full Model" to at least 3 "Reduced Models". Show values of full and reduced models for each criterion.

3. Using your original "Full model", use the `drop1()` function to produce a reduced model. How does this function work? Do the same thing, this time using `step()`. How does this function work? Do they give different results, *e.g.* different models? Provide your *R* outputs.

4. Using the original "Full Model" and any reduced model and compare using an GLM F-test. What are the results? What information is being provided by this test?
