##ANOVA and linear contrasts using real world data!

Below is a random assortment of some real world data collected from streams around Binghamton, NY (*this data is not provided for external use*). There are a number of numeric and grouping variables included in this data set.

These include:

1. Year collected
2. Month collected
3. Stream name
4. Site
5. Water Temperature
6. pH
7. Conductance
8. Depth
9. Flow
10. NH<sub>4</sub>
11. NO<sub>3</sub>
12. Season
13. Land use
14. Stream order
15. Insect richness
16. Insect Shannon's *H*

Your job: 

Run at least 3 ANOVA tests comparing any of the numeric and any of the grouping variables (one-way or two-way). For those tests, provide your results and interpretations of the test. If your results reject H<sub>o</sub>, provide the appropriate pairwise comparisons using the methods listed in [Biostats 250](http://biotoolbox.binghamton.edu/Biostatistics/2014%20Biostatistics%20Zar/Biostatistics%20Worksheets%20pdf/250-2010%20Biostatistics.pdf) and linear contrasts provided in [Biostats 260](http://biotoolbox.binghamton.edu/Biostatistics/2014%20Biostatistics%20Zar/Biostatistics%20Worksheets%20pdf/260-2010%20Biostatistics.pdf). **Make sure that at least two of your comparisons reject H<sub>o</sub>.**

Provide your calculations and results as an annotated .R script to my [email](mailto:mlundqu1@binghamton.edu) by the end of lab. **Groups will be assigned.**
