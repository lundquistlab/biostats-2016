# Multiple regression and GLM exercise #

Last week we used simple linear models to compare a dependent variable (Y) to a single numeric independent variable (X). You can also analyzie multiple predictor (X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,X<sub>3</sub>,...) variables using the **Multiple Regression** technique.

Use multiple regression to analyze the ZarEX20.1aR.txt dataset and answer the following questions:

1. Define your dependent variable
2. Define your independent variables
3. What are the assumptions for multiple regression?
4. Run the partial t/ F-tests of the single coefficients (you can use the built in R function(s))
5. For question 4, does order matter? Why or why not?



You can also generate linear models for nominal independent variables (i.e. factors) much like you can in ANOVA. These are called **Generalized Linear Models** or GLM. 

Analyze the ZarEX10.1R.txt data using GLM and "dummy" coding and answer the following questions:

1. What is a dummy coding/dummy variable?
2. There are multiple levels to the factor feed, show and briefly explain how R codes the dummy variables
3. R defaults to doing treatment contrasts for GLM. Perform a treatment contrasts and explain the results in terms of the comparisons being made and the p-values generated. 
4. Run a cell means contrast. Also exlpain the results in terms of the comparisons being made in that analysis and the p-values generated.
