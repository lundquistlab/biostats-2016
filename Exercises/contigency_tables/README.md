# Goodness of fit and contingency tests

For our last "lab" activity, we will be practicing &chi;<sup>2</sup> tests and 2 X 2 contingency test of association.


1. Use a &chi;<sup>2</sup> test to compare yellow and green seed color in `ZarEX22.1R.txt`. Also run the test with a Yate's correction. Did your observations follow your expected values for both tests? Why would you perform a Yate's correction?

2. Run a G test for the same data (`ZarEX22.1R.txt`). Does this give you a different result than the &chi;<sup>2</sup> test?

2. A McNemar's test is used when you want to compare paired observations over two categorial classes, i.e. "before" and "after." Use the example data from Zar 24.23 (See Biostats 470) to run a 2x2 and 3x3 case of the McNemar test.

3. Answer the following questions:
    1. How would you rate the lab experience in Biostats?

    2. What do you think were the strengths and weaknesses of your lab TA?

    3. What was your favorite topic/aspect of the lab?

    4. What do you think could be improved on in lab?

    5. What is your opinion of the GitHub assignment scheme?
