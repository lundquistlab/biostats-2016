# Week 9 ANOVA exercises

ANOVAs are critical for the analysis of many types of biological data. However, it is sometimes difficult to determine exactly what type of ANOVA to perform and what sort of *post hoc* tests are appropriate after rejecting H<sub>o</sub>. Below are four problems that you need to solve using ANOVA (or other omnibus test) and post hoc analysis (pairwise comparisons, linear contrasts, etc...). 

Please provide your .r commands, results and interpretations.

Problem 1:

Some researchers are interested in methods to reduce stress. They decided to test the effects of mental and physical and medical stress reduction techniques on young, middle-aged, and elderly patients.

Use the data from "health_data.csv" to answer the following questions:

	A. 	Is there an effect of age and 	
		treatment on stress reduction? 
	
	B. 	Is there an interaction between 
		age and treatment?
	
	C. 	Is there a difference between the 
		stress reduction observed in 
		medical and physical methods, and 
		the stress reduction in the 
		mental method?
		
	D. 	Are certain age groups more 
		responsive to stress reduction 
		treatment?


Problem 2: 

A group of chemistry students are wondering how consistent the concentrations of Vitamin A in six different nutrient supplements. They are also interested in the consistency between suppliers of each those supplements. 

Use the data from drug.txt to answer the following questions:

	A. 	What sort of test would you need to 
		run to analyze these data?
		
	B. 	Is there a difference in Vitamin A
		concentration among the supplements?
	
	C. Is there a difference between suppliers of each drug?
	
	D. 	Which drug(s) have significant discrepancies in concentration
		between suppliers?

Problem 3:

Six greenhouse benches were set up as blocks. Within each block, one of each of four varieties of house plants was planted. The plant heights (cm) are provided in plants.txt. 

Answer the following questions:
	
	A. 	Are the maximum heights among the four varieties different?
	
	B. 	Run the nonparametric equivalent (Hint: Fried chicken) to the test 
		run in part A. Are the results similar?
