In *Biostatistics 040* we have a list of general strategies for sampling from a population

1. Random Selection

2. Random Assignment

3. Randomized Trial

4. Block Randomization

5. Stratified Design

6. Blind Design

Here are some studies that could use one or more of these sampling strategies.
    

**Your goal will be to  discuss as a group what strategy should be used in each study and give justififcation for your decision**

#Study 1

Dr. Armstrong is interested in studying the effect of different teaching methods on the test scores of his students in Biol 117. He has eight teaching assistants that run lab each with 25 students. While the overall teaching expectations are the same for all TAs, each individual does have their own skills and teaching methods. 

#Study 2

In Biol 375, Dr. Giardina is having his students test the effects of different levels of predator cues (water that smells like fish) on the behavior of *Aedes triseriatus* larvae. He is interested in exposing the larvae to 0 ppm, 10 ppm, 50ppm, and 100 ppm of this specific chemical cue in the water of their rearing containers.

#Study 3

Dr. Zhu wants to study the effect of salt additions on denitrification in forest soils in the Nature Preserve. He has a 5 ha area he wants to study. He wants to add water containing 0 mg/l NaCl, 1000 mg mg/l NaCL, 10,000 mg/l NaCl, and 50,000 mg/l NaCl.

#Study 4

Dr. Sobel is studying a population of *Mimulus guttatus* in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He is interested in the average seed production in that population. He can obtain this information by collecting seeds from individual plants and counting the seeds under a microscope.

#Study 5

A MD wants to test the efficacy of a new anti-depressant developed from a new flower discovered in the Amazon rainforest. She has access to a population of students diagnosed with depression at a local university and she wants to administer the drug to students willing to be a part of the trial. However, she is well aware of the "placebo effect," therefore, she wants to administer a sugar pill as the control.

#Study 6

To investigate the effects of gut parasites on wood frogs, Dr. Hua collected a population of frogs from the Nature Preserve and reared their offspring, which do not have parasites, in the lab. She is interested in comparing the longevity of those newly hatched frogs between the infected and non-infected groups.
